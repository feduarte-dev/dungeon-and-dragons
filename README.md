## Project Description

This is a project where I apply the principles of SOLID architecture and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in a structure for a role-playing game.

### Technologies

- LINUX
- VSCODE
- NODE.JS
- TYPESCRIPT


### What I Learned

- How to implement classes and interfaces following best practices guided by SOLID and OOP.
- How to transform ideas into a code structure and, with that, initiate new projects.
